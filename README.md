# Fibonatree

-WORK IN PROGRESS-

My attempt to simulate a plant's growth, with the help of Python and Fibonacci.

[Tree diagram](images/full-tree-diagram.png)

## Requirements:

- Tree consists of branches

- Each branch is either a normal "single" branch:
[Single Branch](images/single-branch.png)

- Or is split into two:
[Double Branch](images/double-branch.png)

- The total number of branches after each "generation" equals the following number in the Fibonacci Sequence

- Each individual branch and its resulting "sub-branches" will also follow the Fibonacci pattern
